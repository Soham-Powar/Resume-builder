* **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling
* **html2pdf.js** – for exporting HTML to PDF
* **Vite** – for lightning-fast dev builds

## 🧾 PDF Export

Resume is wrapped in a `<div class="pdf-content">`. Clicking the **Download PDF** button uses `html2pdf.js` to convert this section into a PDF with original spacing and layout preserved.

```js
const element = document.querySelector(".pdf-content");
html2pdf().from(element).set(options).save();
```
